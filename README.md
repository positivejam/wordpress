# About this fork

The purpose of this fork is to allow building the Wordpress Docker image, with modifications to include XDebug.

## Keeping this fork in sync with upstream
This is for my own reference, to do each time upstream gets ahead of mine; from this article: [https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/]()

1. Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to `master` will be stored in a local branch, `upstream/master`.

    ```bash
    $ git fetch upstream
    ```
2. Check out your fork's local `master` branch.

    ```bash
    $ git checkout master
    ```
3. Merge the changes from `upstream/master` into your local `master` branch. This brings your fork's `master` branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.

    ```bash
    $ git merge upstream/master
    ```
4. Push the changes to remote.

    ```bash
    $ git push
    ```
